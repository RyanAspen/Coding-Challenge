**My Explanation**

*To solve this problem, I first researched what a cluster is considered formally. After some searching, I decided to use a centroid-based definition so I could use k-means clustering 
in my solution (fairly fast when compared to other options). I then discovered the Average Silhouette method, which determines the most appropriate number of clusters for a data set.
I used sklearn for easy implementation of this method and pandas to transfer the spreadsheet's data to a more useful format. The solution found is the same as the intuitive solution 
(seems to be 2 clusters from the scatterplot).*
